Stop Animation Display for the Maine Discovery Museum

History:  the stop animation display had been running under windows 98, with proprietary software which is unsupported in 
          later versions of windows OS. Thus, the project is being redesigned with all new hardware, and software. with 
          Added functionality. 
         
Function: users may create stop motion "films" (animated images) and save them for future sharing or download via a coin-op.        

The initial project licence is unknown. However, I am redesigning the hardware, and sofware, to serve the same purpose. Ill figure out the license later.
